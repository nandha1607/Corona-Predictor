# Corona-Predictor
Corona Prediction Python Project. 
Got Data set from the https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series.
The Data set has been filtered manually by me and created a new 10 countries data set from 22/1/2020 to 1/22/2020 to 04/12/2022.
This model predicts the next 10 days confirmed cases and displays them in a table format.
